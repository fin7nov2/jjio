Okay, now moving on from the campaign system, right? For now, I think this is good enough. We are going to work on the QR codes. Right now, you know, there's none of it, right? There's just a, you know, placeholder. Just a mock QR. Doesn't really work or anything. So the problem is that we need to work on is currently the staff enters the customer email, right? And it works, right? But that was just for the preliminary stage. But now we are actually going to integrate the QR. So how it works is the customer shows the QR. So the customer wallet, you know, there's a, in the first page, there's like a show QR. So button, and it shows a QR, right? So that should be an actual QR, right? Secure industry standard professional QR, right? Not a simple one, a proper QR. That then, you know, let's see. That then when the staff, you know, scans it, they could perform actions like redeem rewards or assign points, stuff like that. It has to be a proper QR code. So I don't know how you will actually implement this. Use professional industry standard ways to do this, secure ways. You know, without breaking our app. Integrated seamlessly, professionally. Yeah. Appropriately for our system. Updated in the relevant places that's needed. Right? And there's another area also, right? To redeem rewards, there's like a QR as well. So appropriately do that as well. Yeah. Can you work on that? It has to be complete . And tell me how you implemented it and how I can test it.
